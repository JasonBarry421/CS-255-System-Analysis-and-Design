# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for this project was the fictional company DriverPass which sought assistance in developing a system capable of providing students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. The developed system should be able to be accessed online, preferably over the cloud, from any computer or mobile device. While online, the user should be able to download reports and other information for offline use.


  •	 What did you do particularly well?

I am particularly proud of my work on developing UML Diagrams for the proposed system. Individually, each diagram offers a detailed view of the system. The use-case diagram showcased the different actors who would interact with the system. This facilitated the development of a class diagram to describe the aforementioned interactions in terms more adaptable to object-oriented programming. To ensure the system was properly understood, sequence and activity diagrams were developed to provide a more detailed analysis of the customer’s interaction with the system. I believe that the finished diagrams are a success and provide an accurate visual portrayal of the proposed system.

  •	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise it would focus on the System Design document. Because DriverPass is a fictional organization, I struggled to fully grasp the more intricate details of the required system. Therefore, within the aforementioned document, I would like to include more details on the capabilities of the system as well as how account management works. 

  •	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

User needs are crucial requirements to consider when designing a system. After all, the system exists to accomplish these needs. For example, one DriverPass’ requirements for this project included the ability to be accessed online, preferably over the cloud, from any computer or mobile device. Keeping this requirement in mind helps determine how the system is performed. More specifically, this need describes the system should be hosted on a web server that is compatible with major operating systems (like Windows, Linux, and MacOS) as well as provide support for most modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge).


  •	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

One technique that I would utilize in the future to analyze and design a system is the development of multiple UML diagrams. As mentioned before, UML diagrams offer a detailed view of the system. However, how the system is showcased depends on the diagram used. Therefore, reliance on a single diagram is unlikely to provide a complete and accurate overview of the system. Using multiple diagrams helps alleviate this issue. For example, my activity diagrams showcased how a user interacts with the system. While the sequence diagram accomplishes similar goals, it also helped showcase that two databases are required to validate user information and track the number of login attempts. If I only relied on activity diagrams, I would’ve been unable to come to this realization.
